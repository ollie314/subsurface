TODO for CCR support

- make tank pressure plot work for bailout dives
- bailout handling in SAC rate calculation
- UI to modify the tank type for CCR (i.e., set the diluent and oxygen cylinders)

- UI visualisation of o2 setpoint values and separate oxygen sensor values, probably
  using the same space as the gas partial pressures underneath the depth profile.
