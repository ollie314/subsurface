Build instructions for iOS

[since you have this file, you have already cloned subsurface. Great]

Make sure, you have iOS packages for Qt installed (in my case 5.5 was sufficient).

Get a developper account on developer.apple.com .

Connect your phone, make sure XCode is seeing it in the Devices window. Open one of the
sample iOS apps in XCode click the play button and follow the steps there to create a
provisioning profile. Make sure the bundle Identifier is something like

YOURNAME.subsurface-mobile

Back in the shell

> cd subsurface/packaging/ios
> bash build.sh

In Info.plist.In locate the key CFBundleIdentifier and change its value to

YOURNAME.subsurface-mobile

open QtCreator and there open Subsurface-mobile/Subsurface-mobile.pro

select the Kit iphoneos-clang

and press the play button. Have patience (you can watch the progress in the Compile Output
window).

Make sure the phone is unlocked. Tata!
