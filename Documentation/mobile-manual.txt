[big]#Subsurface-mobile USER MANUAL#

*Manual author*: Willem Ferguson

toc::[]

[blue]#_Version 1.1, September 2016_#

Welcome as a user of _Subsurface_, advanced dive logging software with
extensive infrastructure to describe, organize, interpret and print scuba
and free dives. _Subsurface_ offers many advantages over other similar
software solutions, including compatibility with Windows, Mac-OS/X, Linux (many
distributions), Android and iOS. In addition, _Subsurface_ is
open-source software that allows downloading dive
information from most dive computers.

Introducing Subsurface-mobile
-----------------------------

_Subsurface-mobile_ is an extension of _Subsurface_ which
runs on Android smartphone and tablet devices and is a
tool for viewing or sharing dive information at dive sites where a larger
computer is not useful. _Subsurface-mobile_ for Android also allows
the gathering of GPS locations where dives are performed
(Subsurface-mobile for iOS currently does not support GPS functionality).

_Subsurface-mobile_ allows you to enter and save dive information
using a mobile device. Most users of _Subsurface-mobile_ typically use the
mobile app as an extension to the laptop/desktop version of _Subsurface_.
This allows the storage of dive logs on the Internet sharing them
between the mobile and the desktop versions. But _Subsurface-mobile_ can
be used independently of _Subsurface_ and does not require the use of
cloud storage.
While the desktop version of _Subsurface_ shows much more detailed information
for each dive, the mobile version allows a more accessible dive log
on a dive trip, useful for proving dive experience to dive shops or to review
previous dives.

_Subsurface-mobile_ allows you to:

- Download existing dive log information from the Internet.
- View this information on a mobile device.
- Edit many of the dive log data fields, e.g. divemaster, buddy,
  equipment or notes about a dive.
- Manually create and add new dive records to your dive log.
- Store the updated dive log in the _Subsurface_ cloud storage.
- Record, store and apply GPS positions of dives (Android only).
- View the localities of recorded GPS positions and of dives
  on a map.

These items are discussed in greater detail in the following text.
What _Subsurface-mobile_ does not support (at this time) is downloading
dive data directly from a dive computer. That still needs to be done using
_Subsurface_ on a desktop or laptop computer. We are investigating ways
to support downloading from a subset of the supported dive computers on
Android devices, but this is not yet ready for testing.

== Installing _Subsurface-mobile_ on your mobile device

Find _Subsurface-mobile_ in the _Google Play Store_ or the _iTunes Store_
and install it.

== Using _Subsurface-mobile_ for the first time

Upon starting _Subsurface-mobile_ for the first time, a Subsurface
splash screen is shown while the program loads. On some devices this
may take several seconds. After loading, the _Cloud Credentials screen_ appears
(see image below on left).

Select whether _Subsurface-mobile_ should access the Internet for dive log information.

=== When NOT Using Cloud Storage
Tap the striked-out cloud icon. The app will not access the _Subsurface_
cloud storage server
to obtain dive log information. This means that dive log information is manually
entered and stored on the mobile device only.

=== Using Cloud Storage
In order to use the _Subsurface_ cloud storage, an account on the cloud
server is required. If you have already set up an account from the
_Subsurface_ desktop application, enter the credentials here.

You can also create a new account from your mobile device.

==== Using the desktop version of _Subsurface_:

Open the desktop version of _Subsurface_ and
click _File   ->  Preferences  -> Network_, explained in detail in the
https://subsurface-divelog.org/documentation/subsurface-4-user-manual/#\_create_a_cloud_storage_account[user
manual for the _Subsurface_ desktop version]. Once the account has
been created and verified using the desktop version,
_Subsurface_ desktop alows you to download dive information from dive computers and store this
on the cloud which can, in turn, be downloaded to _Subsurface-mobile_. _Subsurface-mobile_
attempts to download the existing dive log from the _Subsurface_ cloud
server. Appropriate messages are shown onscreen. Finally a list of dives is shown.

Once the dive
list has been downloaded from the Internet, _Subsurface-mobile_ keeps a local
copy on the mobile device. This means that even if there is no Internet connection
at a dive site, you can still access the local copy and view and manipulate
dive information. If there is Internet connectivity, _Subsurface-mobile_ accesses
the cloud-based dive log to verify that the local copy is still the
same as the Internet-stored copy. If not, the local copy and the copy on
the server are synchronised.


image::mobile-images/Credentials.jpg["FIGURE: Mobile landing screen",align="center"]


==== Using _Subsurface-mobile_:

1) Enter an e-mail address and a password in the fields indicated on the screen.
The e-mail should be in lower case and the password should contain a combination of
letters from the alphabet (upper and lower case) and/or numbers. When entering a
password, it is possible to check a checkbox that enables the text of the password to be shown
(image on left, above). At this stage, the red message "Cannot connect to cloud storage" appears on the screen.
This is normal because a valid PIN has not yet been provided (image on left, above).

2) Tap the Disk (Save) icon at the bottom of the screen. A PIN is sent to the
e-mail address provided.

3) Enter the PIN into the field indicated and tap the _Save_ icon again. The user
information is stored on the cloud server and access to the cloud is enabled.

4) The dive list is initially empty. You can now start entering dives in the dive
log or you can download existing dives from your _Subsurface_ cloud
storage account.


== A Few Remarks About The User Interface

At the bottom of many Subsurface-mobile screens is a round button that provides for
several actions and which allows the selection of the main affirmative action
(see image above and image below).
On Android devices, use the Android Back
button for "cancel", "discard" or "back" actions. For example, when
editing dive information, tapping the action button saves the changes while the
Android back button can be used to cancel the edit without saving changes.

On iOS devices, on screens where a "back" action is enabled, a back arrow
is shown in the top left corner of the screen.

image::mobile-images/actionbutton.jpg["FIGURE: Action Button",align="center"]

In order to have a consistent experience between iOS and Android,
_Subsurface-mobile_ on Android does not use the traditional "hamburger"
menu button in the top left or right corner of the screen to open menus.
Instead, _Subsurface-mobile_ uses a
different user interaction philosophy based on the Kirigami framework
developed by the Plasma developers. There are three ways to open the main menu:

- Tap the "hamburger" symbol in the lower left corner of the screen
  (easy to reach for hand held devices)
- Swipe towards the right across the left edge of the screen
- Drag the action button visible on most screens to
  the right

image::mobile-images/menu.jpg["FIGURE: Dive management subpanel",align="center"]

The images above indicate some of the important features of the menu system.
On the left is the main menu that is activated as described above. In the middle is
the menu that opens if you tap the _GPS_ option on the main menu. On the right is
the menu that opens if you tap the _Manage Dives_ option on the main menu.

All screenshots in this user manual are currently from the Android
version. As indicated earlier, the iOS version currently doesn't support
_GPS_ features.

== Viewing the Dive List

Most of the actions of _Subsurface-mobile_ center around the dives on the
dive list. While the dive list is loading from the cloud,
a message appears at the bottom of the screen, indicating that the cloud is
being accessed (see image on left, below). Once the list is loaded you can scroll up and down.
Tapping a dive on the list brings up a display of _Details View_ for that dive (see image on right below).
This includes the dive profile as well as additional information and notes.

image::mobile-images/DiveList.jpg["FIGURE: Dive list screen",align="center"]

You can view other dives by swiping the _Details view_ to the right (for the
previous dive) or to the left (following dive).
Using the Action Bar, it is also possible to delete the dive (tap the dustbin
on the Action Bar) or to view the dive
location on a map viewer (Google Maps on Android, the Google Maps web site
on iOS; tap the GPS icon on the Action Bar.).

== Editing dive details

At the bottom of the dive details screen the _Action Button_ contains a pencil (image on right, above).
Tapping the pencil button brings up a panel with edit boxes that allows you to
change the existing dive information, e.g. adding text to the dive notes
or changing the names or values of some of the information (see image below).
It may be necessary to scroll the window to access all the information.
At the bottom of the edit screen is a _Save_ action button. Tap this to save
the new information. Having saved the data, the dive list screen is
updated and shown. To cancel any edits, tap the Android Back Button or
swipe the edit screen up (fling it away).

image::mobile-images/EditDive.jpg["FIGURE: Dive edit screen",align="center"]

== Adding a new dive to the dive list

You can manually add a dive to the existing dive list. On the dive list
tap the "plus" sign in the _Action Button_, or use the
main menu and tap _Manage dives  ->  Add dive manually_. This opens  a screen that is
identical to the editing screen discussed above. When a dive is added manually, you
cannot directly add a dive profile from a dive computer. However, if you do not use a
dive computer, the duration, depth and several other bits of information about
the new dive can be entered. The _Action button_ at the bottom of the screen
contains a disk symbol. Tap this to save the new dive. To cancel any edits, tap the Android Back Button.
The left-hand image below shows a screenshot of a dive being created and the right-hand image shows
the same dive in _Details View_.

image::mobile-images/ManuallyEnterDive.jpg["FIGURE: Manual dive entry screen",align="center"]

== Deleting a dive

The _Details View_ of a dive has an Action Bar, including a dustbin. If this is tapped,
the dive shown in the _Details View_ is deleted. You have a brief opportunity to undo
the delete by tapping the grey _Undo_ button in the message that appears at the bottom of
the screen (see image below).

image::mobile-images/Delete_undo.jpg["FIGURE: Undo delete dive",align="center"]

You can also delete a dive from the dive list by long-pressing a specific dive
until a red dustbin appears on the right-hand side (see image below). Tap the dustbin. The dive is
deleted without asking any confirmation because _Subsurface-mobile_ assumes that the
combination of a long tap on the dive with another tap on the red dustbin is an unambiguous
instruction to delete the dive.

image::mobile-images/RedDustbin.jpg["FIGURE: delete dive from list",align="center"]

== Dive log management

A central  part of _Subsurface-mobile_ is the ability to store the dive
log using the _Subsurface_ cloud storage.
This provides security against loss or damage to the dive information contained in a local copy of
the dive log and allows the desktop version of _Subsurface_ to
access changes made using the mobile device. This ability is accessed
through the main menu (by dragging the Action Button to the right, or
alternatively tappping the "Hamburger" icon at the bottom left of the screen).
Tap the option _Manage dives_, enabling a number of options:

=== Add new dive manually

This is described above under the section dealing with the dive list.

=== Sync the dive log with the _Subsurface_ cloud storage

You can upload the dives contained on the mobile device
to the _Subsurface_ cloud storage by tapping the option _Manual sync with coud_.
This synchronizes the local changes to
the dive log with the cloud storage. It also downloads changes made on
another device or computer and stored in cloud storage.

=== Working offline or online

By default _Subsurface-mobile_ runs offline and only syncs the dive list
with cloud storage when explicily told to do so (see above).
You can choose to always sync with the cloud servers after every
modification of the dive list. This is not recommended unless you are in
an area with fast and reliable internet connection, as otherwise
_Subsurface-mobile_ might appear to hang between operations as it tries to
connect to the cloud server.

=== Changing the login credentials on the _Subsurface_ cloud

If you need to change your login credentials (for example to work with
multiple accounts) you can
open the main menu and tap _Cloud credentials_. This opens the setup screen
for specifying new credentials.


== Recording dive locations using GPS (Android only).

The fact that most smartphones have GPS facilities allows
_Subsurface-mobile_ on Android to record
the locations of dives. You can take the smartphone on the dive boat
during a dive and locations will be automatically recorded at regular intervals.
These locations can then be applied to dives in the dive list. Here is how it's done:

=== Setting up the GPS

Open the main menu and tap _GPS  ->  Preferences_. Now specify the way
in which GPS data need to be automatically collected (image on right,
below). You can specify that data are collected at regular intervals, e.g.
every 10 minutes, or at regular
distances, e.g. after the boat has moved more than 200m, or a combination of
both of the above approaches. Provide the appropriate information and
tap the _Save_ action button. The program is now ready to collect GPS positions.

image::mobile-images/gpssetup.jpg["FIGURE: GPS setup screen",align="center"]

=== Collecting GPS positions

Ensure that the GPS on the Android device has been activated. At the bottom
of the GPS submenu is a check box _Run location service_ (image on left, above).
Check this box
and _Subsurface-mobile_ starts to collect GPS locations automatically,
following the preferences specified as described above. After return from
the dive trip you can deactivate the collection of GPS data by de-activating
the same check box at the bottom of the main menu.

=== Storing the GPS data on the _Subsurface_ cloud

Activate the main menu and select the _GPS_ option that brings up the submenu of GPS-related actions
(image on left, above). Tap _Upload GPS data_ that saves the GPS data
on the _Subsurface_ cloud server. These GPS data are saved *separately*
from the other dive log data. All collected GPS data are kept on the
Android device, independent of whether they have been uploaded or not.

=== Downloading GPS data from the _Subsurface_ cloud

Download the GPS data that have been saved on the cloud (possibly by a
different device) by
selecting _Download GPS Data_ from the GPS subpanel.

=== Viewing GPS data

From the GPS submenu (image on left, above) select _Show GPS fixes_. This brings
up a list of GPS positions obtained using the location service (image
on left, below). Two actions are possible for each of the locations, enabled if
you tap the handle (the three horisontal stripes on the right, see image on left, below) and
then drags the specific item to the left (image on right, below). This exposes two
options. Tapping the dustbin deletes this particular GPS location. Tapping the
teardrop-shaped icon (actually a Google Maps pin) opens up Google Maps with a pin
indicating the exact map position of the GPS record being viewed. The two above
options can be hidden by drawing the GPS record to the right, again using the handle.

image::mobile-images/gpsmanagement.jpg["FIGURE: GPS management",align="center"]

=== Applying GPS data to dives in the dive log

Assuming that all the dives have been entered into the dive log or have
been downloaded from the _Subsurface_ cloud, you can apply the GPS positions to
these dives. GPS positions can therefore only be applied to dives in the dive list.
From the GPS subpanel, tap _GPS-tag dives_. The dive list contains the start
and end times of each dive. Now, _Subsurface-mobile_ applies the first
GPS position that falls within the dive period of each dive. This results
in a GPS position for each dive that is saved as part of the dive log.
