[big]#Subsurface-mobile pour Android: MANUEL UTILISATEUR#

*Auteur du manuel* : Willem Ferguson

toc::[]

[blue]#_Version 1.0, Mars 2016_#

Welcome as a user of _Subsurface_, advanced dive logging software with
extensive infrastructure to describe, organize, interpret and print scuba
and free dives. _Subsurface_ offers many advantages over other similar
software solutions, including compatibility with Windows, Mac-OS/X, Linux
(many distributions) and Android (iOS under development). In addition,
_Subsurface_ is open-source software that allows downloading dive
information from most dive computers.

Présentation de Subsurface-mobile
---------------------------------

_Subsurface-mobile_ est une extension de _Subsurface_ sur ordinateurs. Il
fonctionne sur les smartphones et les tablettes Android et c'est un outil
pour visualiser et partager des informations de plongées sur des sites de
plongées où un ordinateur n'est pas utile. _Subsurface-mobile_ permet
également de collecter des positions GPS où sont effectuées les plongées.

À cause des limitations d'iOS, _Subsurface-mobile_ pour iOS n'inclut pas
toutes les fonctionnalités présentes dans la version Android.

While _Subsurface-mobile_ allows one to enter and save dive information
using an Android device, users of _Subsurface-mobile_ typically use the
mobile app as an extension to the laptop/desktop version of _Subsurface_.
This allows the storage of dive logs on the Internet sharing them between
the Android and the desktop versions.  While the desktop version of
_Subsurface_ shows much more detailed information for each dive, the mobile
version allows a more accessible dive log on a dive trip, useful for proving
dive experience to dive shops or to review previous dives.

_Subsurface-mobile_ allows one to:

- Download existing dive log information from the Internet.
- View this information on a mobile device.
- Edit many of the dive log data fields, e.g. divemaster, buddy, equipment or
  notes about a dive.
- Manually create and add new dive records to one's dive log.
- Store the updated dive log on the Internet.
- Record, store and apply GPS positions of dives.
- View the localities of recorded GPS positions and of dives on a map.

These items are discussed in greater detail in the following text.  What
_Subsurface-mobile_ does not support (at this time) is downloading dive data
directly from a dive computer. That still needs to be done using
_Subsurface_ on a desktop or laptop computer. We are investigating ways to
support downloading from a subset of the supported dive computers on Android
devices, but this is not yet ready for testing.

== Installing _Subsurface-mobile_ on an Android device

Find _Subsurface-mobile_ in the _Google Play Store_. Search for
_Subsurface-mobile_ and install it.

== Using _Subsurface-mobile_ for the first time

Upon starting _Subsurface-mobile_ for the first time, a Subsurface splash
screen is shown while the program loads. On some devices this may take
several seconds. After loading, the _Cloud Credentials screen_ appears (see
image below on left).

Select whether _Subsurface-mobile_ should access the Internet for dive log
information.

=== When NOT Using Internet access
If the striked-out cloud icon is selected, the app will not access the
Internet to obtain dive log information. This means that dive log
information is manually entered and stored on the mobile device only.

=== Using Internet access
Since _Subsurface_ is largely dependent on a dive log saved on the Internet,
provide a PIN for access to the _Subsurface Cloud_, obtained in one of two
ways:

==== Using the desktop version of _Subsurface_:

Open the desktop version of _Subsurface_ and
click _File   ->  Preferences  -> Network_, explained in detail in the
https://subsurface-divelog.org/documentation/subsurface-4-user-manual/#\_create_a_cloud_storage_account[user
manual for the _Subsurface_ desktop version]. Once the account has
been created and verified using the desktop version,
_Subsurface_ desktop alows one to download dive information from dive computers and store this
on the cloud which can, in turn, be downloaded to _Subsurface-mobile_. _Subsurface-mobile_
attempts to download the existing dive log from the _Subsurface_ cloud
server. Appropriate messages are shown onscreen. Finally a list of dives is shown.

Once the dive list has been downloaded from the Internet,
_Subsurface-mobile_ keeps a local copy on the mobile device. This means
that, if there is no Internet connection at a dive site, one can still
access the local copy and view and manipulate dive information. If there is
Internet connectivity, _Subsurface-mobile_ accesses the cloud-based dive log
to verify that the local copy is still the same as the Internet-stored
copy. If not, the local copy and the copy on the server are synchronised.


image::mobile-images/Credentials.jpg["FIGURE: Mobile landing screen", align="center"]


==== Using _Subsurface-mobile_:

Enter an e-mail address and a password in the fields indicated on the
screen.  The e-mail should be in lower case and the password should contain
a combination of letters from the alphabet (upper and lower case) and/or
numbers. When entering a password, it is possible to check a checkbox that
enables the text of the password to be shown (image on left, above). At this
stage, the red message "Cannot connect to cloud storage" appears on the
screen.  This is normal because a valid PIN has not yet been provided (image
on left, above).

Tap the Disk (Save) icon at the bottom of the screen. A PIN is sent to the
e-mail address provided.

Enter the PIN into the field indicated and tap the _Save_ icon again. The
user information is stored on the cloud server and access to the cloud is
enabled.

The dive list is initially empty. One can now start entering dives in the
dive log or one can download existing dives from the cloud.

The text box to enter the PIN is shown whenever the e-mail address field is
empty.  One can create a new cloud account by clearing the e-mail address
and typing a new e-mail address, upon which a new PIN is sent to the
newly-provided e-mail address.  On the other hand, one can change to a
different existing cloud account by providing an e-mail address and password
already registered with the cloud server (image on right, above)

Once Internet access has been enabled, one can temporarily disable this
service when using _Subsurface-mobile_ in areas with no Internet access,
e.g. remote dive sites (see below)

== A Few Remarks About The User Interface

At the bottom of many Subsurface-mobile screens is a round button that
provides for several actions and which allows the selection of the main
affirmative action (see image above and image below).  On Android devices,
use the Android Back button for "cancel", "discard" or "back" actions. For
example, when editing dive information, tapping the action button saves the
changes while the Android back button can be used to cancel the edit without
saving changes.

image::mobile-images/actionbutton.jpg["FIGURE: Action Button", align="center"]

Instead of the more traditional "hamburger" menu button in the top left or
right corner of the screen to open menus, _Subsurface-mobile_ uses a
different user interaction philosophy based on the Kirigami framework
developed by the Plasma developers. To open the main menu one has three
options:

- Tap the "hamburger" symbol in the lower left corner of the screen (easy to
  reach for hand held devices)
- Swipe towards the right across the left edge of the screen
- Drag the action button visible on most screens to the right

image::mobile-images/menu.jpg["FIGURE: Dive management subpanel", align="center"]

The images above indicate some of the important features of the menu
system.  On the left is the main menu that is activated as described
above. In the middle is the menu that opens if one taps the _GPS_ option on
the main menu. On the right is the menu that opens if one taps the _Manage
Dives_ option on the main menu.

== Viewing the Dive List

Most of the actions of _Subsurface-mobile_ center around the dives on the
dive list. While the dive list is loading from the cloud, a message appears
at the bottom of the screen, indicating that the cloud is being accessed
(see image on left, below). Once the list is loaded one can scroll up and
down.  Tapping a dive on the list brings up a display of _Details View_ for
that dive (see image on right below).  This includes the dive profile as
well as additional information and notes.

image::mobile-images/DiveList.jpg["FIGURE: Dive list screen", align="center"]

One can view other dives by swiping the _Details view_ to the right (for the
previous dive) or to the left (following dive).  Using the Action Bar, it is
also possible to delete the dive (tap the dustbin on the Action Bar) or to
view the dive location on a map viewer (normally Google Maps; tap the GPS
icon on the Action Bar.).

== Editing dive details

At the bottom of the dive details screen the _Action Button_ contains a
pencil (image on right, above).  Tapping the button brings up a panel with
edit boxes that allows one to change the existing dive information,
e.g. adding text to the dive notes or changing the names or values of some
of the information (see image below).  It may be necessary to scroll the
window to access all the information.  At the bottom of the edit screen is a
_Save_ action button. Tap this to save the new information. Having saved the
data, the dive list screen is updated and shown. To cancel any edits, tap
the Android Back Button.

image::mobile-images/EditDive.jpg["FIGURE: Dive edit screen", align="center"]

== Adding a new dive to the dive list

It is also possible to manually add an additional dive to the existing dive
list. On the main menu tap _Manage dives -> Add dive manually_. This opens a
screen that is identical to the editing screen discussed above. When a dive
is added manually, one cannot directly add a dive profile from a dive
computer. However, if one does not use a dive computer, the duration, depth
and several other bits of information about the new dive can be entered. The
_Action button_ at the bottom of the screen contains a disk symbol. Tap this
to save the new dive. To cancel any edits, tap the Android Back Button.  The
left-hand image below shows a screenshot of a dive being created and the
right-hand image shows the same dive in _Details View_.

image::mobile-images/ManuallyEnterDive.jpg["FIGURE: Manual dive entry screen", align="center"]

== Deleting a dive

The _Details View_ of a dive has an Action Bar, including a dustbin. If this
is tapped, the dive shown in the _Details View_ is deleted. One has a brief
opportunity to undo the delete by tapping the grey _Undo_ button in the
message that appears at the bottom of the screen (see image below).

image::mobile-images/Delete_undo.jpg["FIGURE: Undo delete dive", align="center"]

One can also delete a dive from the dive list by long-pressing a specific
dive until a red dustbin appears on the right-hand side (see image
below). Tap the dustbin. The dive is deleted without asking any confirmation
because _Subsurface-mobile_ assumes that the combination of a long tap on
the dive with another tap on the red dustbin is an unambiguous instruction
to delete the dive.

image::mobile-images/RedDustbin.jpg["FIGURE: delete dive from list", align="center"]

== Dive log management

A central part of _Subsurface-mobile_ is the ability to store the dive log
using the _Subsurface_ cloud storage.  This provides security against loss
or damage to the dive information contained in a local copy of the dive log
and allows the desktop version of _Subsurface_ to access changes made using
the mobile device. This ability is accessed through the main menu (by
dragging the Action Button to the right, or alternatively tap the
"Hamburger" icon at the bottom left of the screen).  Tap the option _Manage
dives_, enabling a number of options:

=== Add new dive manually

This is described above under the section dealing with the dive list.

=== Upload dive log to the _Subsurface_ cloud storage

One can upload the dives contained on the mobile device to the _Subsurface_
cloud storage by tapping the option _Manual sync with coud_.  This
synchronizes the local changes to the dive log with the cloud storage.

=== Download dive log from the cloud storage

In the dive management subpanel, tap the option _Manual sync with cloud_,
causing the local divelog to be refreshed from the cloud so that the cloud
and local versions are synchronised.

=== Working offline

Sometimes one wishes to use the app when an Internet connection is not
available, for instance at remote dive sites. In such a case
_Subsurface-mobile_ may unnecesarily search for an Internet connection,
causing long delays in executing some functions. In the dive management
menu, one can turn the Internet access on or off by tapping the _Offline
mode_ or _Enable auto cloud sync_ options.

=== Changing the login credentials on the _Subsurface_ cloud

It may be necessary to change one's login credentials, for instance if one's
email address (initially used as a credential) has changed. To change the
credentials, open the main menu and tap _Cloud credentials_. This opens the
setup screen for specifying new credentials.


== Recording dive locations using GPS.

The fact that most smartphones have GPS facilities allows one to record the
locations of dives. One can take the smartphone on the dive boat during a
dive and locations will be automatically recorded at regular intervals.
These locations can then be applied to dives in the dive list. Here is how
it's done:

=== Setting up the GPS

Open the main menu and tap _GPS -> Preferences_. Now specify the way in
which GPS data need to be automatically collected (image on right,
below). One can specify that data are collected at regular intervals,
e.g. every 10 minutes, or at regular distances, e.g. after the boat has
moved more than 200m, or a combination of both of the above
approaches. Provide the appropriate information and tap the _Save_ action
button. The program is now ready to collect GPS positions.

image::mobile-images/gpssetup.jpg["FIGURE: GPS setup screen", align="center"]

=== Collecting GPS positions

Ensure that the GPS on the Android device has been activated. At the bottom
of the GPS submenu is a check box _Run location service_ (image on left,
above).  Check this box and _Subsurface-mobile_ starts to collect GPS
locations automatically, following the preferences specified as described
above. After the dive one can deactivate the collection of GPS data by
de-activating the same check box at the bottom of the main menu.

=== Storing the GPS data on the _Subsurface_ cloud

Activate the main menu and select the _GPS_ option that brings up the
submenu of GPS-related actions (image on left, above). Tap _Upload GPS data_
that saves the GPS data on the _Subsurface_ cloud server. These GPS data are
saved *separately* from the other dive log data. All collected GPS data are
kept on the Android device, independent of whether they have been uploaded
or not.

=== Downloading GPS data from the _Subsurface_ cloud

Download the GPS data that have been saved on the cloud by selecting
_Download GPS Data_ from the GPS subpanel.

=== Viewing GPS data

From the GPS submenu (image on left, above) select _Show GPS fixes_. This
brings up a list of GPS positions obtained using the location service (image
on left, below). Two actions are possible for each of the locations, enabled
if one taps the handle (the three horisontal stripes on the right, see image
on left, below) and then drags the specific item to the left (image on
right, below). This exposes two options. Tapping the dustbin deletes this
particular GPS location. Tapping the teardrop-shaped icon (actually a Google
Maps pin) opens up Google Maps with a pin indicating the exact map position
of the GPS record being viewed. The two above options can be hidden by
drawing the GPS record to the right, again using the handle.

image::mobile-images/gpsmanagement.jpg["FIGURE: GPS management", align="center"]

=== Applying GPS data to dives in the dive log

Assuming that all the dives have been entered into the dive log or have been
downloaded from the _Subsurface_ cloud, one can apply the GPS positions to
these dives. GPS positions can therefore only be applied to dives in the
dive list.  From the GPS subpanel, tap _GPS-tag dives_. The dive list
contains the start and end times of each dive. Now, _Subsurface-mobile_
applies the first GPS position that falls within the dive period of each
dive. This results in a GPS position for each dive that is saved as part of
the dive log.
