"_Subsurface_ downloads the information stored on the SDA (the built-in file "

"you don’t enter a device name, but instead the location where the UEMISSDA "

"is a drive letter ( often 'E:' or 'F:'), on a Mac this is "

"After selecting the above device name, download the dives from the Uemis "
"Zurich. One technical issue with the Uemis Zurich download implementation "
"(this is a Uemis firmware limitation, not a _Subsurface_ issue) is that you "
"cannot download more than about 40-50 dives without running out of memory on "
"the SDA. This will usually only happen the very first time you download "
"dives from the Uemis Zurich.  Normally when downloading at the end of a day "
"or even after a dive trip, the capacity is sufficient. If _Subsurface_ "
"displays an error that the dive computer ran out of space, the solution is "
"straightforward.  Disconnect the SDA, turn it off and on again, and "
"reconnect it. You can now retry (or start a new download session) and the "
"download will continue where it stopped previously. You may have to do this "
"more than once, depending on how many dives are stored on the dive computer."
